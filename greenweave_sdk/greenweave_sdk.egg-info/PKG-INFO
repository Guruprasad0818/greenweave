GreenWeave SDK makes any OpenAI-powered app carbon-aware with one line change.

Change:
    from openai import OpenAI

To:
    from greenweave_sdk import GreenWeave as OpenAI

That's it. Every AI call is now:
- Carbon-routed to the most efficient model for current grid conditions
- Semantically cached (repeat queries = 0 CO2, ~2ms)
- ESG-logged for compliance reporting
- Budget-tracked with automatic model downgrade
